    "## Recursion and functions\n",
    "> What stops us from using iteration in the main body of the program instead of recursive functions? Do we strive for the fewest lines of code in the main body, while having all the code in function form?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. It's totally fine to have iteration instead of recursion. But some problems are much easier to write recursively than iteratively. We haven't seen many of those problems yet. In particular **tree operations** and some **graph operations** are easy to write with recursion and harder to write iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages *only* have recursion and don't have iteration at all. This is generally a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How are variables defined in loops local if they can be accessed in the global scope?\n",
    "\n",
    "They have the scope of their definition. So they will are local to the current scope (if that's global, it will be global). They don't define a *new* scope, but inherit the scope where they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can recursion only involve one function, or can it involve several in a cycle?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no restriction. This is **mutual recursion** and is occasionally used. It can be hard to track what is going on unless you are very disciplined.  There is an example in the C part of the lab.\n",

    "## Code criticism: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\n",
    "One very easy to recognise indicator of poor code quality is **repetition**. Code shouldn't be repeated. Copy-and-paste code is a sign of a hack job. Repetition should be coded as iteration (if possible) or if the problem doesn't require *exact* repetition, the code should be packaged up into functions \"factor out\" the repeated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why no Ctrl-C / Ctrl-V?\n",
    "Why is this bad? Repetition means that you have different parts of the program doing very similar things. What if you wanted to change the behaviour of all the code consistently (e.g. to fix a bug or add a feature)? You'd have to go through each repetition and change or fix it. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if one copy of a bit of code was very slightly different? It's very hard to recognise slight differences when when things are repeated, because the human perceptual system filters the variation out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repeated code is inflexible, fragile, hard to read and hard to keep consistent.** It makes your life harder, and it indicates that the problem hasn't been thought out about enough to boil it down into simple, reusable components.\n",
