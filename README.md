# ipynb_online

This project contains **Lecture Notes**&mdash;Jupyter Notebook Python lectures from year one at University of Glasgow.

Jupyter (IPython) notebooks you can view here on github, or click the **NB** link to view them on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) (which sometimes works better). If you want to *run* the notebooks, not just view them, you can clone the project.
