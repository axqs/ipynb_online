# ipynb_online

This project contains **Lecture Notes**&mdash;Jupyter Notebook Python lectures from year one at University of Glasgow.

Jupyter (IPython) notebooks you can view here on github, or click the **NB** link to view them on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) (which sometimes works better). If you want to *run* the notebooks, not just view them, you can clone the project, or run all the notebooks online by clicking this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/norvig/pytudes/master), or click the **DN** link to run each individual notebook on   [deepnote](https://beta.deepnote.org/).
